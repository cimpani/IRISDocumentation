Welcome to the documentation for IRIS Radio Astronomy
=====================================================

IRIS is a cooperative community creating digital research infrastructure to support STFC science. This
site documents how to sign up for IRIS resources like IRIS (through certificate), Galahad, DIRAC/Safe, submit jobs on these resources and provides example Radio Astronomy workflows.

 For more details about IRIS, we recommend `What_is_IRIS <https://www.iris.ac.uk/>`__
